    <strong>Total Rate Calculation:</strong><br>
    <code>Total Rate = Base Rate × Container Count</code><br><br>
    <strong>Where:</strong><br>
    • <strong>Base Rate:</strong> The per-container rate charged by the carrier for a specific SCAC-Port-Facility combination<br>
    • <strong>Container Count:</strong> The number of containers shipped on that specific route during the selected time period<br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> If Base Rate = $500 and Container Count = 10, then Total Rate = $5,000<br><br>

    <strong>Cheapest Rate Calculation:</strong><br>
    <code>Cheapest Base Rate = MIN(Base Rate) for each Lane</code><br><br>
    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
    • <strong>Lane:</strong> A unique combination of Port + Facility (e.g., USLAX + IUSF)<br>
    • <strong>Process:</strong> For each lane, the system finds all available carriers (SCACs) and identifies the one with the lowest rate<br>
    • <strong>Cheapest Total Rate:</strong> Cheapest Base Rate × Container Count<br><br>

    <strong>Potential Savings Calculation:</strong><br>
    <code>Potential Savings = Total Rate - Cheapest Total Rate</code><br><br>
    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
    • Shows the dollar amount that could be saved by switching to the cheapest available carrier for each lane<br>
    • Represents the difference between what you're currently paying vs. the lowest available rate<br><br>

    <strong>Week Number Calculation:</strong><br>
    <code>Week Number = ISO Week Number from SSL ATA Date</code><br><br>
    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
    • Extracted from the SSL ATA (Actual Time of Arrival) date in the GVT data<br>
    • Uses ISO 8601 standard where weeks start on Monday and week 1 contains January 4th<br>
    • Allows analysis of shipping patterns and costs by week<br><br>

    <strong>Savings Percentage Calculation:</strong><br>
    <code>Savings % = (Potential Savings ÷ Total Rate) × 100</code><br><br>
    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
    • Shows what percentage of current costs could be saved by switching to cheapest rates<br>
    • Higher percentages indicate greater optimization opportunities<br><br>

    <strong>Performance Data Integration:</strong><br>
    <code>Performance Score matched by Carrier (SCAC) + Week Number</code><br><br>
    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
    • Performance data is matched when the Carrier in performance data equals the Dray SCAC(FL) in GVT data<br>
    • Week numbers from both datasets must match exactly<br>
    • Performance scores are displayed as percentages and averaged in summary tables<br>
    • Allows evaluation of cost savings opportunities alongside carrier performance metrics<br><br>

    <strong>Example:</strong> For lane USLAXIUSF:<br>
    - SCAC A charges $500 per container<br>
    - SCAC B charges $450 per container<br>
    - SCAC C charges $475 per container<br>
    - Cheapest Base Rate = $450 (SCAC B)<br>
    - If you have 10 containers:<br>
      • Total Rate = $500 × 10 = $5,000<br>
      • Cheapest Total Rate = $450 × 10 = $4,500<br>
      • Potential Savings = $5,000 - $4,500 = $500<br>
      • Savings % = ($500 ÷ $5,000) × 100 = 10%<br>
      • Performance Score = 82.1% (if SCAC A has 82.1% performance for that week)
